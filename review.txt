Reviewer:
The manuscript titled "An Extremely Deep Rubin Survey to Explore the Extended Kuiper Belt and Identify Objects Observable by New Horizons" proposes a Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling micro-survey of the Kuiper Belt. Using the shift-and-stack technique, the survey aims to provide transformative measurements of the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) size distribution, identify potential observation targets for the New Horizons mission's LORRI camera, and study KBO rotational properties across different distances, sizes, and orbital classes. The authors outline the survey plan in detail and discuss the potential scientific applications of the resulting data. The manuscript aligns well with the goals of the special issue on Rubin LSST Survey Strategy Optimization.

However, the manuscript appears to have been prepared on a short timeline, and I have several suggestions to strengthen it before publication:

Inconsistent Scheduling - The proposed survey schedule is inconsistent throughout the manuscript. The abstract states that observations will begin in summer 2026, while Section 3.5 mentions, "A similar timeline for objects discovered in the July-August 2025 or 2026 oppositions by a Rubin micro-survey would be possible." I understand that the authors hope to start as early as possible, but given the current schedule of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a July-August 2025 start date is not feasible. The timeline should be clarified and made consistent throughout the manuscript.

Probability of Finding a New Horizons Flyby Target - In line 108, the manuscript states, "New Horizons is the only spacecraft currently operating in the Kuiper Belt, providing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to observe distant KBOs up close." Similarly, line 126 mentions, "while providing a chance to find a new distant encounter target for the spacecraft to explore." These statements suggest that the survey might identify a new flyby target for New Horizons. However, Section 3 does not provide any explanation or estimation of the probability of this occurring. Including a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of finding such a target would strengthen the manuscript's claims. Since Figure 4 already presents relevant information, the authors should clarify whether it is possible to extract a numerical estimate from it.

Rotational Light Curves and Stacking Strategy - Section 2.5 discusses the use of rotational light curves. However, since a single 30s Rubin exposure reaches only ~24.5 mag at 5σ in the r band, it is unclear how many stacked exposures will be required to reach the stated threshold of r < 26 for sources at the 10σ limit (line 283). Additionally, as the micro-survey will only observe for five hours per night, obtaining shape information for all objects brighter than r = 26-particularly for slow rotators-seems overly optimistic. The claim that "This will provide some shape information for ~100 KBOs." should be better justified or revised to reflect a more realistic estimate.

Depth of Single Exposures - In line 374, the manuscript states, "a single 30s exposure whose 5-σ limit was varied between 27 and 28.5 in r." This appears to be an error, as a single exposure will not reach such depths. The authors should clarify whether this is a typo or if the statement refers to stacked exposures rather than individual ones.

Grammar and Formatting Issues - There are incomplete sentences in line 270 ("At 70 au, objects that with r = 27 have Hr ∼ 8.5") and line 349 ("In addition, other deep survey's have not"). Additionally, there are missing commas, periods, and other typographical errors throughout the manuscript. A thorough proofreading is recommended to correct these issues and improve overall readability.
